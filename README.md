# Calories_burnt_using_ML
I have done this Project In Python using, using Regression Model. I have used some basic python libraries like Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib and some not so common but very useful libraries like seaborn and sklearn.

**Inferences**

I have drawn some inference from data about correlation of all entities with each other for instance what happens to calories when duration of exercise is more or what happens to body temp when duration of exercise is more . I have depicted all these entities with the help of corellation plot where 1 means highly correlated and 0 means not at all correlated .
