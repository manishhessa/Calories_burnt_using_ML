# Calories_burnt_using_ML
I have done this Project In Python using, using Regression Model. I have used some basic python libraries like Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib and some not so common but very useful libraries like seaborn and sklearn.

**Data Depiction**

I have depicted all entities of calories and exercise Data in the form of plot to see the trend for instance age is an entity so there is standard normal plot which says about range of age which is more actively exercising like that for other entities , and also so that we can draw inferences out of dataset given . 

**Inferences**

I have drawn some inference from data about correlation of all entities with each other for instance what happens to calories when duration of exercise is more or what happens to body temp when duration of exercise is more . I have depicted all these entities with the help of corellation plot where 1 means highly correlated and 0 means not at all correlated . 

**Uses**

This project has wide uses in field of Health & Fitness and smart watches . Now a days users want their calories burnt measurement to be more accurate .
